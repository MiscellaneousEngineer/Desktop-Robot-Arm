A small robotic arm I made to explore the technology a bit
The movement system based on some custom 3D printable Cyclodial drives.
Controller made from parts I had lying around.

About the drives:
They are ~80% 3D printable (including the outer bearings) and peform pretty well for what they are. They were designed with a 20:1 reduction ratio, taking 0.72NM from the Nema 17 motor and giving 14.2 NM at the output (if the efficiency was 100%).
They use minimal hardware and were designed so I could make them with what I had lying around - screws and heat set inserts, as well as a handful of 608 bearings.
