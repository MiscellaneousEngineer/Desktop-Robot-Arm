A small robotic arm I made to explore the technology a bit

The movement system based on some custom 3D printable Cyclodial drives.

Controller made from parts I had lying around; I'll probably get around to drawing up a schematic but it's just a bunch of stepper drivers and some salvaged voltage regulators.

About the drives:
They are ~80% 3D printable and peform pretty well for what they are. They were designed with a 20:1 reduction ratio, taking 0.72NM from the Nema 17 motor and giving 14.2 NM at the output (if the efficiency was 100%).
The drives handle the torque just fine, I didn't have any faliures, there is flex however as the drive turns.

They use minimal hardware and were designed so I could make them with what I had lying around - screws and heat set inserts, as well as a handful of 608 bearings - which lead to me making the outer bearings print in place, which after some testing, ended up working pretty well.
